excerpt: 'This study investigates how the construction and operation of the Ui-Sinseol Light Rail Transit (LRT) affected apartment prices in the surrounding areas. Using multiple regression analysis, it examines how proximity to the LRT stations and local amenities, such as schools, influences housing prices. The study differentiates between the eastern and western areas along the rail line, highlighting that the western region, which lacked alternative transportation infrastructure, experienced more significant price increases due to improved access provided by the LRT. Conversely, the eastern region, served by both the LRT and Line 4, saw a lesser impact from the new rail line. The study also considers the evolution of property prices before, during, and after the LRT’s construction, giving a phased perspective on its influence. This research provides a foundational understanding of how the LRT reshaped real estate prices in the area by improving transportation access.'
