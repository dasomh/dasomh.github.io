excerpt: 'This research examines the effects of the Ui-Sinseol Light Rail Transit (Ui-LRT) on surrounding apartment prices in Seoul. Using a multi-regression analysis, the study explores how proximity to the Ui-LRT stations influences housing values, with particular attention to regional differences. The findings reveal that while the western areas experienced significant price increases due to better connectivity, the eastern areas exhibited a more modest impact. These results provide insights into the varied role of transportation infrastructure on real estate markets in urban settings.'
