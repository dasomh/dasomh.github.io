excerpt: 'Although initially a semester project, this study was presented at an academic conference with the support of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in recognition of its outstanding research results. This study examines how proximity to Chicagoâ€™s L Train impacts housing prices, with a focus on areas within and beyond a 1-mile radius of the stations. Utilizing multiple regression and geographically weighted regression (GWR), the analysis highlights the significant role of transportation infrastructure in shaping local housing markets, revealing both positive and region-specific effects on property values.'
